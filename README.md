# Credit_Risk_Analysis
Apply machine learning to solve real-world challenge: credit card risk 
(build skills in data preparation, statistical reasoning, and machine learning) 

## Overview of Project

**Machine Learning** (*supervised, unsupervised, & deep*) is the use of statistical algorithms to perform tasks such as learning from data patterns and making predictions. The basic procedure for implementing a *supervised learning* model are-- 1) Create a model, 2) Train the model, and then 3) Create predictions. The two main uses of supervised learning are: *regression* and *classification*. For this project, we worked with Jill (the lead data scientist) to employ different techniques to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes. We used *imbalanced-learn* and *scikit-learn* (python machine learning libraries) to build and evaluate models using resampling. Using credit card credit dataset from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company, we oversampled the data using the *RandomOverSampler* and *SMOTE* algorithms, and undersampled the data using the *ClusterCentroids* algorithm. Then, we used a combinatorial approach of over-and undersampling using the *SMOTEEN* algorithm. Next, we compared two new machine learning models that reduce bias, *BalancedRandomForestClassifier* and *EasyEnsembleClassifier* to predict credit risk. At the end, we evaluated the performance of these models and made a written recommendation on whether they should be used to predict credit risk.
